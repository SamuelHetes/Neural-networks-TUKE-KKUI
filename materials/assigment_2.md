# Team project 

The semester project will consist of 5 member teams that you choose yourself. Unfilled teams will be merged or supplemented additionally without the possibility of change.
Individual teams will choose from published topics on which they will work throughout the semester. Individual topics will be assigned a mentor who will communicate and consult on the issues of the given topic.


## Term of team project
- Understand the given issue, create an analysis of the project at hand, and propose a workflow for the project (subsequently consulting with your mentors).
- Develop a functional solution for the chosen topic in the form of a Proof of Concept (PoC) or a DEMO application.
- Establish regular code review committees (this helps track who worked on what) using only the repository/GitLab provided to you.
- It's also necessary to create a summary article (using a 2-column template) by the set deadline, describing and documenting your solution from a more technical and scientific perspective.
- Prepare a final presentation that you will then deliver at the closing presentation.


## Final presentation
At the final project presentation, individual teams show their solutions in front of other teams and mentors. 
At the presentation, you must also point out who was involved in which part of the project solution.

**Participation in the final presentations is mandatory.**
